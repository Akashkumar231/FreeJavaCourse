Usage of FileReader and FileWriter is not recommended because :
While writing data by fileWriter we have to inset /n manually which is varied from system to system it is difficult to the programmer.
While reading data using fileReader we can read the file by character by character.
To overcome these problem we should go for buffered writer and buffered Reader.

  NOTE:-

   The main problem with fileWriter is we have to insert line separator manually which is varied from system to system
   It is the difficulty to the programmer and therefore we use buffered writer and PrintWriter classes.
