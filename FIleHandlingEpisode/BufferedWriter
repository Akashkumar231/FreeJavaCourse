 BufferedWriter = We can use the Buffered Writer to write the content the file

  Constructors

1) BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w);

2) BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w, int bufferSize);

  Note : BufferedWriter can't communicate with the file directly

  Methods:
1) write(int ch);
2) write(char[] ch);
3) writer(String s);
4) flush();
5) close();
6) newLine();

 FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("Hello.txt");
      BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
      bw.write("Akash");
      bw.write('\n');
      bw.write("is a Good Boy");
      bw.newLine();
      bw.write(" How are you");
      char [] ch = new char[]{'K','U','M','A','R'};
      bw.write(ch);
      bw.flush();
      bw.close();

      Note : Whenever we are closing Buffered writer automatically internal file writer will be closed and we are not require to close explicitly
