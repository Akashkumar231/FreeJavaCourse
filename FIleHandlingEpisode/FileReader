 FileReader : We can use FileReader to read character data from the file.

                                                           Constructors

 FileReader fr = new FileReader(String fname);
 FileReader fr = new FileReader(File f);
    METHODS

1) read();

   It attempts to read nextCharacter from the file and returns its unique code value if the next character not available then this will return -1;
   As these methods return unicode value at the time of printing we have to perform typecasting;

2) int read(char [] ch)

    It attempts to read enough characters from the file and returns number of characters copied from the file.

3) void close()


By using FileReader we can read data character by character which is not convinient to the programmer
