BufferedReader : We can use Buffered Reader char data from the file
The main advantage of  Buffered Reader when compared with file Reader is we can read data line by line in addition to char by char

  Constructors:

  BufferedReader br  = new BufferedReader(Reader r);

  BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r, int bufferedSize);

  Note : Buffered Reader can't communicate directly to the file and it can communicate via some reader object

  Methods:

  int read();
  int read(char [] ch);
  void close();
  String readLine();

  It attempts to read nextLine From the file and returns it if the next line not available then this methods returns null.

  The most Enhanced Reader that read data from the file is BufferedReader.
