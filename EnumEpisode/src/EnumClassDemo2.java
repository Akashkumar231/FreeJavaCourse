public class EnumClassDemo2 {
//    Conclusions:

//    1)Every enum is always direct child class of java.lang.Enum and here our enum can;t extend any other enum and java not provide support for Multiple Inheritance.
//    2)Every enum is always final implicitly and hence for an enum we can`t create child enum.
//    3)Because of above reasons we can conclude that inheritance concept not applicable for enum explicitly and we can't use extends keyword for enum.

//    Note : Anyway an enum can implements  any number of interfaces.
