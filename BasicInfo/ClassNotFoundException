1)  Introduction____

Both ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError occur when the JVM can not find a requested class on the classpath. Although they look familiar, there are some core differences between these two.

2) ClassNotFoundException
ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception which occurs when an application tries to load a class through its fully-qualified name and can not find its definition on the classpath.

This occurs mainly when trying to load classes using Class.forName(), ClassLoader.loadClass() or ClassLoader.findSystemClass(). Therefore, we need to be extra careful of java.lang.ClassNotFoundException while working with reflection.

3) NoClassDefFoundError
NoClassDefFoundError is a fatal error. It occurs when JVM can not find the definition of the class while trying to:

Instantiate a class by using the new keyword
Load a class with a method call
The error occurs when a compiler could successfully compile the class, but Java runtime could not locate the class file. It usually happens when there is an exception while executing a static block or initializing static fields of the class, so class initialization fails.
