In Java there is a type for every variable and expressions.Each and every data types is clearly defined , Every assignment
should check by the compiler for type compatibility.
Because of above reason we can conclude java language is strongly typed programming language.
Is java a pure Object Programming language or not ?
Java is not considered as the pure object programming language because , several oops feature is not supported by java
like operator overloading and multiple inheritance , and more over we are depending on primitive data types which are not
object types..
There are 8 primitive data types
 1) Numeric data types    and    2) Non Numeric data types(char , boolean)
 Numeric data tpes are divided into two types
 1) Integer data types :- int, byte , short, long
 2) Floating type data types :- double , float
 Note:- Except Boolean , and char remaining data types are considered as signed data types because we can represent both negative and positive numbers
 Byte data type is used, when we want to transmit the data over the network or to write the data in the file, the byte data type is supported
 over the network stream and also for the file .
